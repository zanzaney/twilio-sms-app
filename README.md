This is a tutorial for making your own SMS application using Twilio for free!

## Step 1

:pushpin: Create a Twilio Account by clicking on this link: https://www.twilio.com/
:pushpin: Navigate to the options in the menu to start your journey with Twilio! I have started with Programmable Messaging for this tutorial.
 

## Step 2

:pushpin: Create a folder on your Desktop. 
:pushpin: Create a Python file in the folder and name it as `Credentials.py`. This file will contain your credentials.
:pushpin: Add your details like Account SID, AUTH Token, your Twilio Number, your cellphone number (the number that is supposed to receive the message).
:pushpin: Create another Python file and name it `send_sms.py`. This is where your Python code to send an SMS goes!
:pushpin: Run your code file(`send_sms.py`) using terminal. 

## Step 3

Ta-da! You have created your own SMS application using Twilio and Python for free! :sparkles:
