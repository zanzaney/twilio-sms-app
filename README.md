This is a tutorial for making your own SMS application using Twilio and Python, for free!

## Part 1

:pushpin: Create a Twilio Account by clicking on this link: https://www.twilio.com/ <br>
:pushpin: Navigate to the options in the menu to start your journey with Twilio! I have started with Programmable Messaging for this tutorial. <br>
:pushpin: Click on "Get Started link". <br>
:pushpin: Get your Twilio Number (Accept whichever one is provided). <br>
:pushpin: In "Send a Message" box, type your message content in the "Body" tab. <br>
:pushpin: Click on "Make Request" button. <br>

## Part 2
 
:pushpin: In your terminal, type `pip install twilio`. <br>
:pushpin: Create a folder on your Desktop. <br>
:pushpin: Create a Python file in the folder and name it as `credentials.py`. This file will contain your credentials. <br>
:pushpin: Add your details like Account SID, AUTH Token (Account SID and AUTH token can be found in the console), your Twilio Number, your cellphone number (the number that is     supposed to receive the message). <br>
:pushpin: Create another Python file and name it `send_sms.py`. This is where your Python code to send an SMS goes! <br>
:pushpin: Run your code file(`send_sms.py`) using terminal. <br>
